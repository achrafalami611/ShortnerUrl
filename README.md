# Project Documentation: Using Service Classes in Laravel/Vue.js

## Introduction: 

Welcome to our Laravel/Vue.js project! This document aims to provide an overview of our development approach, specifically focusing on utilizing Service Classes and Resources instead of putting all logic in the controllers. By adopting this approach, we aim to achieve better code organization, maintainability, and separation of concerns within our application.

## Advantages of Using Service Classes and Resources
  
### 1 - Improved Code Organization: 
Separating business logic from the controllers allows for cleaner and more maintainable code. This helps in understanding, debugging, and making changes to the application's functionality.
  
### 2 - Reusability: 
Service Classes encapsulate specific logic, making it easier to reuse that logic across different controllers or projects without duplication.
  
### 3 - Testability: 
The logic within Service Classes can be easily unit tested, leading to better code quality and reliability.
  
### 4 - Enhanced Security:
By centralizing data manipulation and validation in Service Classes, we can apply consistent security measures across the application.
  
### 5 - Better API Responses:
Resources allow us to customize the data presentation in API responses, ensuring the output matches our requirements without exposing sensitive information.

## Getting Started

### 1 - Clone the Repository: 
Begin by cloning the project repository from GitHub.
  
### 2 - Install Dependencies: 
Use composer install (In Laravel Directory) and npm install to install the required PHP and JavaScript packages, respectively.
  
### 3 - Database Setup: 
Configure the .env file with the appropriate database settings, and run php artisan migrate to create the necessary database tables.
